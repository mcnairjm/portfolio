            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello! My name is John McNair. I am a web-developer in training and I am excited to continue learning and growing with these new subjects. I was born and raised in Raleigh, NC and currently live there with my wife, Sara. I graduated from Appalachian State University in 2017 with a Bachelor's Degree in Communication Studies. While I found Comm Studies to be interesting and helpful in many different ways, it did not supply me with any specialized skills outside of being a good communicator.  After considering a few different options, I landed on web development as an area that I felt I could not only learn, but eventually excell at and, hopefully, one day reap the benefits of that field. I look forward to building out this page even further in the future and filling it up with my own projects. Cheers!</p>
